# preact-static

Very small and basic template for Preact using TypeScript, Webpack and TSX. This template is specifically designed to allow the build to be ran locally without a web server for embedding purposes. Not really sure how usable it is at this stage yet, so I may update it further.

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't know how to use Webpack ðŸ™‚
